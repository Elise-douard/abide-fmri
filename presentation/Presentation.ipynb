    "* `fragment`: this is to split the contents of one slide into pieces; a cell marked as a fragment will create a break inside the slide; it will not show up right away, you will need to press Space one more time to see it.\n",
    "* `skip`: this cell is ignored altogether in reveal mode, it will not appear either in the main view, nor in the speaker view.\n",
    "* `notes`: similarly, this cell is marked to be discarded from the main view, but is meant to appear in the speaker view."
